Uploads the test data to the MySQL database. You'll probably want to give the MySQL database location as the fist parameter, in SQLAlchemy format, e.g. "mysql://username:password@host:port/database". See http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html for full details.

Note that the input file is not located in this repository so that the repository is kept small. You could use any SQLite file (named "inputData.sqlite" in this repository), or you can download the one I was using (instructions to come).
